# 3D-Rendering-Project

Welcome to **3D-Rendering-Project** – a repository that chronicles my journey into the world of **OpenGL** using **C++**. From learning the basics of rendering triangles to experimenting with 3D transformations, shaders, textures, and lighting – this is my self-guided adventure through the 3D graphics pipeline.

## 🚀 About This Project

This project is both a **learning log** and a **sandbox**. I’ve used it to experiment with:
- Core OpenGL concepts (VAOs, VBOs, EBOs)
- GLSL Shaders (vertex, fragment, and a little bit of fun with lighting)
- Texture loading and manipulation
- Model transformations and camera systems
- Perspective vs orthographic projections
- Real-time rendering techniques

All examples are written in **modern OpenGL (3.3+)** with **C++**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **C++**
- **OpenGL 3.3+**
- **SDL2** – Window & input
- **GLAD** – OpenGL function loader
- **stb_image** – Image loading
- **GLM** – OpenGL Mathematics

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- [x] First triangle 🎉  
- [x] Colored geometry  
- [x] Textured cubes  
- [x] Dynamic lighting  
- [x] Camera movement (FPS-style)  
- [ ] Model loading (coming soon!)  
- [ ] Shadows and post-processing (stretch goals)  

## 🧠 What I Learned

This repo isn’t just code – it’s a reflection of hours of learning, debugging, reading docs, and watching tutorials. I learned how 3D rendering works under the hood, what makes GPUs tick, and why graphics programming is both a science and an art.

## 🧩 Dependencies

Make sure you’ve installed the following:
- C++ compiler (supporting C++14 or newer)
- SDL2
- GLAD
- GLM
- stb_image

## 🧭 How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Rendering-Project.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd 3D-Rendering-Project

# Build using your preferred method
open 3D-Rendering-Project.sln
```

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Load .obj/.fbx models
- Implement a basic scene graph
- Add GUI (Dear ImGui?)
- Try Vulkan or WebGL as a next step

## 📸 Screenshots

Coming soon – because who doesn’t like seeing spinning cubes in action?
